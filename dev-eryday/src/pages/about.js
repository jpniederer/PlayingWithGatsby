    <h1>About Dev-eryday</h1>
    <p>Dev-every is a personal project created by Joshua Niederer to aid in becoming a better software developer. This site serves to log my efforts and to share knowledge, creations, insights, and whatever else I discover along the way. I'm a professional software developer with the goal of becoming as great as I can be.</p>
    <p>The philosophy behind Dev-eryday is to improve every day. The name, "Dev-eryday," comes from combining the word "Development" with "every day" to help promote the every day aspect of improvement. Through continually improving, lots of little gains grow into phenomenal growth over time.</p>
